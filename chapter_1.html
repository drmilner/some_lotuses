            <p class="indent">Wisconsin skies then shifting as fall smells litter the earth. The sky swings like a pendulum; the intimation of a voice intoning or suggesting behind the walls, the way a memory does in an old house; Treetops hum-hawing with potency, air frosted and denoted in its thickness.f</p>
            <p class="noTop">“she could’ve gone to one of those glass islands in the sink?”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“or broke her outlines on the couch.”</p>
            <p>John D. Portheim and Anderson (Dan) L. Wallace: Detectives of Antioch, WI and/or Chicagoland IL, are investigating the disappearance of a girl last seen in her bedroom, where a tab of acid made her recede into the walls and they’ve been looking ever since, but the windows held no witness n divulged nothing to the dicks lining the cages for dusts and clues. </p>
            <p>They left the house and walked holding hands along the lakefront, smoking alternately. They ate ice cream in the lakefront afternoon with their tight easy smiles and loose coats, fishing in all their pockets with black gloves; occasionally John would lean over and administer a little kiss on Dan’s nose. They dipped their fingers in their coffee when they dipped their donuts, they flicked the liquid on the grass. He took out a sketchbook. “Sunken grey eyes. Beautiful green eyes.”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“Her mother’s eyes.” </p>
            <p>They rub eachothers' thighs in the cold breeze thru corduroy pants while kids play soccer far off. Portheim rubs Wallace’ eyelids so gently, wiping away cold tears. Children kick the ball and the daytime moon is half-full in the sky. “He’d never let her out of the house…”</p>

            <p>4 Days earlier</p>
            <p class="indent">She bolted straight and convulsed in the blue dust pierced by the projector.</p>
            <p>Her life condenses, breathing loudly in the basement, thumbing along the window like a horizon, fogging wet plaster walls. Dad summoning her to his maelstrom of spilt beer and old pancakes. So she stashes the weed, and ascends the thick nervous soup of the stairs to come and find him daring her to meet his eyes and snuff out her pale light, “…this house is getting security cameras, inside and out.”</p>
            <p class="indent">In her basement-bedroom, she’s surrounded with animals. Humidifier steam, records and tapes are stacked around, and her paintings, which were like squiggly colors, plus posters and tapes, tapes, tapes. The window arced bright and cold when the cars came by deposing their headlights on her wall. There’s a constant tension. She had affixed her life to certain ideals like a pin thru paper, and when the paper wastes away she forgot what she was supposed to be. Animals (hairless rats, roaches, newts, frogs, cats, a stingray, fishies, hamsters, painted turtles, millipedes, dogs, big dog, pink axolotl w frock collar, dart frogs), move around as she scribbles the implications of gloss systemic surface-sheen of Facelessness Generation —wrapping me up in a suffocating dress of pure silverblue noise that flashes off ur white walls from the windo running up into my mouth nd cunt, til I put a rock thru the center of that face and BREAK it.…</p>
            <p class="indent">Annie’s headed toward a godhead of color and fire— feels destined for wheeling & dolt-dreaming— running full-speed toward a precipice ( the tension building up all through childhood a giant  s l i n g shot…) and hoping the momentum would carry her over to the other side somewhere safe and unknown. Her mouth was small, her ears like pink puffy shells— sallow chin, and short, blunt eyelashes. On the couch she’s looking at at the display of screen of the universe, and connives to herself: none of this is real. NAFFING IS REAL.</p>

            <p>Plodding thru streets in the snow and pass shoveling men on the sidewalks over to the library and am under golden lights, frozen bridges, darkened storefronts and rooves covered in twinkling. From work, my feet look at tall branches see my breaf and put rocks in my pocket— iliik at airblaens bumbielimng into the ends of twigs that twiddel and shake (buming in green waterdrops hit eachother) frm th last circle drop reflected all th big winneka houses.</p>
            <p class="indent noTop" >In her father’s home on Social posting and residing in images —reproducing my own image all the time— She leaves— only taking one rat— to the train. Taking acid impatiently in the thickets of bushes beside the tracks, and lying under the dock on the sand watching her chest and fingers move somnambulantlywer id once finger self— rescinds altogether from her half-a-home. She is off in a spooled-out reality on the Loop’s rattly winding tracks, and potential meanings are trapped forever on a fixed planar existence and coasting around in circles cause (ahm cant go home and can’t go anywhere else….. I’m locked in a wheel of decision-making whose continual motion is the only true so long as i’m in moving in it. Every possible surface reconfiguring its textures— waiting to blow-up in the moment and capture them and me truly and latently as props— to metastasize into the airy projection-surface,  (burning a hole in the screen)— to experience “it”… so she’d stayed on, feeling she's spinning over and over—in an infinitely recursive line in front of a pinwheel sun…</p>
            <p class="indent noTop">She dismounts the train in chicago and walks around looking at blue powder taxi cabs under the L-train squares of lite runn thru blacc metal and cars, and can’t help feeling every time the CIRCUIT/NP_COMPLETEs, that she’s bound to be here. Sparkling and awed by this, she reboards, running the yellow cardboard back through the turnstile maybe a million times backwards. I can’t find the motivation or evidence sufficient to get me off this train because she’s obliged to another cycle by the end of the last loop; ordained to smaller rotations of infinite iterations like gears of an artificial body.. . fingers’ skins are like baking dough and her books’ words are swarming like ants who got upset & lost their chemical sense of direction, and the the floor is sweating.</p>
            <p class="indent noTop">She is not socially nervous, tho she is nervous in her character. Everything is really too rapid-quick changing for her to process because all these background activities of her mind are in fast forward every time she recognizes them they get denoted as part of a formula, slightly quickened and improved on each successive passthrough so the whole thing starts spinning concentrically quicker, inputting the outputs, drawing in to its center.. Drawn into the spin getting heavier heated up and terrified too of reaching her center… she tries to set it right, but hours ago lost her sense of volition in the telephone. Or maybe a minute ago. She could tell-- Breathing in chlorine— the trains stopped and getting out is being born, and she could see the weedgrown signs outside and cracked-paint woodbenches under awnings of metal and graffiti’d opaque windows and numbers for hookers and pictures of models holding expensive water bottles that shed always been coming here cus the opposites ends of the universe had paralleled out and converged revealing the total balanced picture hidden in the possibilities of the middle of will which were NEVER REALLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE…</p>

            <p class="bold">THE DETECTIVES SIT BY THE LAKE</p>
            <p class="noTop">Outside her house with pens and pads, and Dan is smoking corner-lip.</p>
            <p class="noTop">“Ok we might as well get started. last known place of residence?”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“bedroom”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“last seen?”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“computer science class at the Y. Or” he squints, “information theory.”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“boyfriend?”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“off working for the Farest Service I think”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“hey c’mere and give me a kiss” they give one that pops over the lagoon; trees manipulated  into movement, them fingering up twisty in the gray void. Wallace tucks his arms closer, puffing his coat, “mmmmmmmmTake a loooooooooode off annnay!”</p>
            <p class="noTop">"take a looooooade fuh freeeeee!”</p>
            <p class="noTop">"what a sweet girl.”</p>
            <p class="noTop">They tenderly kiss and then hooked their arms to drink their coffee. Wallace decides to light up a joint— they puff, and by degrees begin to watch glimmers on the leaves. Annie used to smoke in this spot and feel good for seemingly impossibly short before getting wrapped up in bigger, weirder problems that clung to her every surface— so she’d surf on in vague terminology to explain them away, making them more engrossing in a discurisve interior dialogue that only made sense gramatically and made her want to cry like she were pleading with ghosts hoping they would help her. They’re in her head, and it didn’t feel like communicating. Do you know me?</p>
            <p class="noTop"> Dan held close to John’s shoulder.</p>
            <p class="noTop">“you're not gonna be out again are you?”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“…”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“—because last time we smoked you get off on tangential things and walk until morning.”</p>
            <p class="noTop">“someone’s fussy”</p>
            <p class="noTop"> Dan juts his lip and retracts his arms, “whatever.” and sees a helicopter pod membrane twirling. Its veins stickout in microcosm of curves and pattern, John feels warmth on his face, prickling his cheeks on the cold day, watching the trees swish and hum….</p>
            <p class="noTop">“Why another girl go to go?”</p>
            <p class="noTop">Cars passed. John and Dan traded the roach between them. They snuggled close and saw the ducks swim and bob to stick out their asses, sticking out shaking feathers, and preening…</p>
            <p>They felt the walls for incongruent features, knelt to the floor and examined the height and bevel of the boards, the reflexivity of the varnish, and what kind of dead bugs were in the cracks, where the grain lay, looked inquisitively at the stained glass enclosures. John took a sample of wooddust from the windowell, he pinched it in a narrow cylindrical sensor from his breast pocket and pulled out his notebook: jotting down the haze of blue it comprised, and plotted it. They’re looking for a point of departure. He caught Dan looking.</p>
            <p class="noTop">"you delight me to no end”.</p>
            <p class="noTop">“stahp. We need to overlap the floor," (take pictures) "pictures in the bathroom would be useful“.</p>
            <p class="noTop">"Another idea. We hire an intern to live here for 4 or 5 weeks: lazes around the house long enough to acquire the cell grid, excise his parasubiculum, hippo, slurp up his entorhinal maps, suck em right out."</p>
            <p class="noTop">“Suck what?“</p>
            <p class="noTop"> They're stroking eachother softly thru their pants and looking in the eye, suddenly working hard to be austere like they’re vying secretly for dominance.</p>
            <p class="noTop indent">One lets go first, "anyways.”</p>

            <p class="noTop indent">Theres a disconnect, unfortunately. When money is accumulated fine enough it becomes particulate. It blows onto surfaces of walls, floor, kitchenware, furniture-- so they might as well be screens forever displaying their owners. When I got sent home from college, I learned u need to be able to count the major surface materials in a room on one hand... mom didn’t. Everything is moving to fast, trends, aesthetics, hypersensitive, right down to the font on the demo booklet for flooring — a constant definition of status. Changing every to a new a Style she couldn't actually afford, then ur basically in a room w impossibly thin TV covering over walls; uncontrollably reloading the precedent to your thoughts, speech, and actions.</p>
            <p>Mom had found that slowly and gradually things faded to the point that that surfaces weren’t so noticeable because their source of light slowly fades, and rotation of her possessions cease to be novel & interesting, and all prettyness of her face and hair and (very expensive) clothing, the drapes, the backyard, sweaters on the dog, fad exercise equipment and pool and appliances and all these things become translucent in the passage of time. Mom found herself in a cycle of changing surfaces flitting by, and til it felt kind of peculiar after a while almost like she’s in a <i>lit up room, waiting to leave. Petrified under all these priced displays which in their fast-quick coming & going</i> (to pliant and support the goods economy) <i>becomes invisible the faster they rotate, like fanblades, and she’s flickering still behind as a display element.</i><span class="white">which will be the best or worst moment of her life. after a while because everything is just surfaces well lit like an office high window floats randomly in icy fogsrolling thru endless portentous cities—  fade to clear flimsily and sunlight thru in the gods’blow of the afternoon</span></p>
            <p class="noTop indent">the higher echelons of society we squeezed into, moving into the second duplex house, the updating, debt-run iterations began to unravel and billow like sheets flung in a vast wind, as things start to fall away in concussion of the ripping air, mangling the first image that promised perfection, and mom’s tether frayed as she became less visible except thru surfaces; all her branches twisted entwined and violent exploding like fireworks flying out into rattling atmosphere which is really death of existing at all meeting the air. Fed, walled-in the perfect rich suburb she looks out (on the patio of a department store) and feel the cold of the yawning blue expanse— alone as child naked at blue dawn.  Rolled in the street to do some violence to it; now undecorated walls fly with ghosts against whom conceit is impossible. In the darkness a shadow appears as a real, socially present entity.</p>
