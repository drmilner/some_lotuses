            <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
            <p>John and Dan drove an old brown sedan with tinted side-mirrors pretty low to the ground, prone to scraping over yellow speedbumps and cruising beneath slopey telephone wires. They parked by the gravel pit under the great arcs, which were buzzing perennially and humming in the insect dusk.</p>
            <p>John pulled a medium sized boxy thing out of the trunk. It was almost all screen, with no buttons besides a small remote in his breast pocket. It had an embossed ‘g’ in the google font, and the word ‘Calico’.</p>
            <p> in his detective’s blazer and brown shoes, he ran out an extension cord. They hooked it up to an outlet in the nearby church parkinglot streetlamp and conducted a government approximation of prayer, (this was 6 or 7 blocks from annie’s house on Winnetka Rd) “ok here goes:”</p>
            <p>—SNAP… BLLLOOOOOOOIIIIHNNNKKSS— and the screen faded up in very desaturated semicolor in the haziest fuzziest faintest scanlines was the grainy and blurred form of a body, maybe, in a small room with a window and some curtains. they can make out thru the distorted rolls and tricolor scanning the image of her somatoform ululation and  some kind of room with some floral drapes and a door.</p>
            <p>AdBaby came on to their great relief. What a funny baby.</p>
            <p>Sponsor fathers from time immemorial took care of this perfect baby, and instilled it with professional  values that should befit men of their classed upbringing. Such a shiny baby. Soon John and Dan are rolling on their backs in the gravel,</p>
            <p>“WWAAAHAHAHHAHHA WW-W—W-W-W- WAHAHAHAHHAH”</p>
            <p>“HEEWWWUUUUGHHHH, WUGHM. HICK HICK HICK”</p>
            <p>with eyes contorted to an uncomfortable star, shut tight, wheezing,</p>
            <p>“HO-HO-HOMYEGOD, wuh… WAAHAHAHAH”</p>
            <p>on the static screen with dirty streetlight on it, AdBaby sat on a hardwood floor, apparently viewed by a handheld camera with a ‘Coke’ brand hat tumbling over his eyes.</p>
            <p>“TH-TH-THAT HAT IS TOO BIG—BUH— BLAHAHAHUHA”</p>
            <p>“HOR-HICH HICK HICK AHHA, AHUH, AHA!”</p>
            <p>John is wiping the dusty tears away.</p>
            <p>“Well… wha- whaHAHUCK… thaah— that was a good one… huuuhh. Urhgm… wow ah.”</p>
            <img src="placeholder.gif">
            <p> in minutes they were back in their car, computer still glowing blue— giving eachother furious grey-dusty handjobs out of their unzipped dark brown slacks, undone leather belts, sweating to their shoes, and grunting, pulling at (Dan’s was a little darker) their cocks and archbacking on the lowered wet leather seats, with just the light from the fold-down mirror, and from the blue multicolor (like a plastic overlay) of the rearview seen them writhe in yellowy ecstasy with the (see the willow?) waving out the back window. And John’s glasses have fallen over his mouth while he clenches the upholstery, grimacing disgustely, until he nuts into Dan’s collar… and falls slack in his seat.</p>
            <p>The two of them heaving in the humid interior or cadillac glazed-orange-sun buzzling in glass blues Dancing on their shirts, eyes shone, and breathing, last drips of silver into the crotches of their pants. </p>
            <p>“uhhghhh.”</p>
            <p>[beat]</p>
            <p>“Um” wiping the fog from his glasses, “there’s not realistically enough in our budget to hire an intern.”</p>
            <p> He talks breathily with his lips curling out, painting his eyes, blushing his cheeks. He takes his gun off the dashboard and holsters it over the seatback.</p>
            <p>He pulls ignition’n zooms off the gravel shoulder. The car took off like a low flat shark in a brown suit - speeding in the dark, pants sticking on thick legs, Dan is putting on mascara in the mirror.</p>
            <p>he hummed a song, glancing in the steering wheel. Tall trees tear by lit up white for brief intervals as they fly thru ravines and muddy lagoons. The sounds came w low noise garbled by the tiretreads.</p>
            <p>“whashi…”— he listened closer.</p>
            <p>“poll over.”</p>
            <p>John pumped the brakes and now he can hear it too above the engine idle.</p>
            <p>Dan unbuckled out and dashed to the back,</p>
            <p>“…ho god.” </p>
            <p>“What!?”</p>
            <p>“its crying!!”, Dan is flapping his hands.</p>
            <p>John steps beneath the wavng monster blu trees, sticks cracking in the wind where the birds slept.</p>
            <p>a deer leaped from the roadise into the wood with one bound. “Oh babe!”</p>
            <p>“please be quiet now.”</p>
            <p>on the screen the Baby lay on a kitchen floor under the gaze of a wobbly tape camera held at adult chest height. One of those dog-fences separated it from the next dark room, from where u heard the noise and saw the vacillating blue and white and grey colors of a computer screen. AdBaby now had on an understated Ralph Lauren patchwork cottonwool cardigan w a pastel-colored figure of a man skiing in a long hat over the breast ($105), and now a pair of Kenneth Cole Reaction 'Barton' Suede Derby Shoes in white (Baby, Walker, Toddler, Little Kid & Big Kid, for $95), and Seersucker Casual Woodsman Shorts, ($85), from which two milky white chubby legs extruded, kicking thunderously, knocking the plastic blocks across the tile floor: “PURCHASE”</p>
            <p>A dialogue comes up, “$285, ARE YOU SURE?” John smashes the “BUY” button and nearly sprained his thumb.</p>
            <p>The Baby went quiet.</p>
            <p>When he had fallen back asleep they placed it carefully in the trunk and drove to the Mellonkamp house.</p>

            <p>Even after it has been developed and is in operation, the procognitive system of the year 1997 has a continuing need for programming specialists. Their task is, essen- tially, to maintain and improve the basic programs of the system… To change even one short statement in a large system of programs is a serious matter, to be undertaken only by the most skilled and experienced professional program- mers. The programmers of the procognitive system, therefore, plan modifications carefully, test them thor- oughly outside the main stream of operation of the system, and then monitor the situation closely when they intro- duce the modifications into actual operation.</p>

            <p>(This is the room one night watching you turn grey and sky blue, pass a tunnel of water; you stood in the doorway, floating over all those invisibl countries and invisible cities that glow in waterdrops, dripping into the bleeding heart of america, past listless boundaries like broken fences, sinewed trash, nd i slept in shrubs, underbridges, and tracks by freightcar and lumbermill, but its not that fun, and a bit cold too, to be nowhere and be anyywhere at the same time.)</p>

            <p>“the thing about this darn old economy is that you’ve got to feed it, without nourishment, its gonna die, just like you or…anyone would. And we do have many responsibilities. People need incentives, you understand. Your image is the most valuable part of you; it is the only thing from which you are provably there at all. And it also the only thing thats infinitely reproducible. You are a media sensation of many surfaces, incessantly fractured in reiterations of salient visual features. You can spin the firework in any moment, it "catches on", sure, viral. Hucrck— annie. We’ll need your memories. Not just your recent ones. All of them. We need your future memories. A lot of boys are going to look.  hes got all places, he says, in the world backed up on a goldplated 4µm thumb drive transmitted thro his hand as he nears her neck.</p>

            <p>“They won’t do anything else. Look at your skin… See themselves in reflection.   thats a service to people. Servicing them. You are the only one, so give me the pictures and people will laugh with you and it’ll all be very sexy and adorable. Ahah-hah. and semen, ha-ha, for whoever. We don’t judge: we identify markets. Whatever one needs to get into a banner-ad, interstitial ad, native ad, And so on forever happy, enclosed, alone, taken care of. Individual desire cultivated, stimulated, and serviced, are on retention. All products in perpe-tchuit-ee in user life. Impossibly fine displays, crystal ash blown on the sides of your ruined house, watch all memories flow, past lives, like your parents’… It’ll come on slow, sure: little things will go. Windshields, kitchen tables, and the obvious ones. Vanities, bedroomdoors, windows, ceilings, mirrors, clothing, leaves, sidewalks, and of course above your head at night.  These screens will be two-way viewing of course.” he simulates smiling,</p>
            <p>“an invisible pixel.. a transparent implant— go anywhere… be anyone… first we need your memories” He’s wiping off his glasses and as his fingers move her eyesight wipes away, “to train new A-N-Ns“. The gold touches her. Rain lights under the awning, an intersection in Glencoe, Catholichurch, school, shop windows under rain. (“this is you born in a departmentstore, looking out the gloomy gel windows. Jeans and sweaters lying in… refracted starlight— streetlights on fake wood tables,”) “needs a body-referent— you understand...  your nonactor, non-celebrity status makes you per-fectly authentic and relatable. You’ve got a funny laugh and also are cute and sexy and wise and innocent and mature. You can understand and Relate to All People. You’ll get to travel the world trillions of times, to every nighttime street and surreal rural road and forest footpath and alleyway and every inch of the earth thus far mapped, but remain essentially undifferentiated… what a miracle.” He leans in with a face like mottled wet concrete, wrinkling on itself. “We’ll just need your pictures Annie. Yur face in a yawning colorful stream… . We know you like to take pictures. Your pictures. You were a very cute girl.  you wanted to be seen. Dont smirk at me… been waiting for the right One to notice, ghrm?” his eyebrows raise. “haghhhhgh. You can become the pirgh-fect human image. and you'll sleep in everyone’s pockets: right up against their skin, almost, where its safe, its innately secure, harmless…. We’re building-for-Billions” he drably intones, setting off a scripted event as he stands up.</p>
            <p>“hold still” the blood rushes. [sounds of a restaurant fade out]</p>
            <p>“…high Edgerank over time decay, solid affinity, social diffusal loading…  Transcription… loaded…” The  sound is everywhere, all the over her skin with tactile simulation. Pink, blue, purple, 3D animated isomorphic sex in beautifully rendered surfaces on her soft, rearranging shimmery-body’s surface. His voice was placeless, “localize sound objects… hello? Enjoying yourself?” Her breasts were inflating, changing color, glowing, and dissappearing in her skin like a loose bag of slowly rebounding neon liquid silicon reverberantly, like a halo jump glitch.  “We’ve been noting social scores, running pagerank in length and breadth of demographics: judging your fitness for World-Salience. That was us annie, looking back. Looking for you, through  every screen… ever since— you first wanted to. Remember?”. She noticed now that he was only ever visible from the front, so he was always facing her without having to rotate. I don’t know where I am.</p>
            <p>Ad-replica in the skybox reflecting everything as smaller, writhing, bright civilizations. And then he took me up there to where the world becomes small, and showed me all the satellite police forces of the world in a moment in time. “I have authority over all these kingdoms, and I can give them to you, or whomever i please.”  His eyes are filled with boundless black clouds.</p>
            <p>“we need a vessel, a basin, fill like rain. Become anyone if you want… annie you are welcome to become anyone… attention is labor; labors that makes bodies; this labor is free money and we are experiencing boom times. We can make you watched forever in real-time*. We will just recquire a slight… transduction. The unqiue parameter that viewers will identify in you will be generated in less time than the second it takes load an ad. Of course you’ll get to be an emblem.” he holds his phone w black fingernails, sluffing disinterested glaze eyes like he’s dissecting a grey deep sea creature.</p>
            <p>“Properly transcribed. I might add. Accurate. you’re lucky, see, who else gets this. your sister wont. After a certain age. Once every bit is ours… then— pop!” he throws up his hands with a cackling and mucousy cough and drops them like stones to the counter,  “ahugh-haha…  I can see you’re blushing. That’s why you’re the star, Annie! All rooms are watching you:  I pull & twist your camera huck hugh hurk… Every visible surface evocative for split-second romance, each of their fragments generating news; newness is revenue. there’ll never be a dull moment...You can understand and Relate to All… strings of sun-glinting glue. Just you eat yourself. EAT YOURSELF.”</p>

            <p>theres stars in my eyes and everything is grey. We’re at the table again. “must’ve judged you smarter than this, look at you, you look like a deer. And where’d you be without me? unknown stupid? better watch for cars… now you need to consolidate. One AI Profile for the next three billion. We can have you wrapped in glass every inch, project movies in your skin from personalization sex seed. And everyone wants to see his face in the reflection off your round, shining ass.”</p>

            <p>Rubber gripper socks. Some guys sat around a table with folded hands. After I sign the papers one finally speaks. “Annie…try not to white knuckle it.” He means like “You know, like when your’e driving, to look at your hands, and check if they turned white gripping the wheel.” He has the pursed, compassion of a stranger who knows what is possible. I got my clothes back.</p>
            <p>Into the intersection under descending snow, green and red in the christmas lights, I hustled down a black street. I check my pocket first thing. Allie is in there, thankyou thankyou thankyou, hungry, quick-expanding-and-contracting back steaming out a little puff of vapor. He was with me both days, but it was hard to hide him. My other pocket was filled with jawbreakers.</p>
            <p>After outprocessing I flew, shoes wet, i could see the wavering horizon smudge past all that wind and scattered heat of reflections on storefronts, houses and front yards and christmastrees together through the dense cold. I could see a forest stood. Got to go quick and get to California.</p>
