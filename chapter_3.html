            <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>Around noon John and Dan were lying on the couch at her house, with the TV, and they were fucking so hard that Dan had John behind him, lying on their sides, and John held his shoulder on the right side for leverage to force his hips— creaking the ceiling, gasping all sweaty, and so itchy from the pet hair on it, with the TV playing some weird old movie with men speaking Japanese. John tensed up and started wrenching his hips faster, his abs aching, when just then they heard keys in the door. WELL, John shot n’ bolted up the stairs, as the sudden sound of a motorcade of engines choking off and the door flies open, and theres Don Mellonkamp with his face full of sudden sweat and ardor, stashing his belly in his pants, keys jingling, as the two men rapidly and compose their wet selves.</p>
            <p>Don was unphased. “Where’s my daughter you faggot freeloaders?”</p>
            <p>“we’re— we’ve been working on it Mr. Mellonkamp. Dan’s been mapping the house we just need to—“</p>
            <p> After a few seconds John blinks and sniffs affirmatively. Don realizes in a moment of dissonance that he, and in a way, his face, and personality, were all leaning forward and up on tip toes, and making the biggest impression he could make. Don haunches back,</p>
            <p> “what— is it a question of access?”</p>
            <p>“No no I mean we. No. Its just we need more time, thats all.”</p>
            <p>His pale grey blue eyes flip like whips.</p>
            <p>“Now you, you still have that thing that I gave you?” </p>
            <p>“yeah” they both said together. John shoves his chin towards the black, cubish computer device partly concealed behind the couch. </p>
            <p>“and you’re…” his eyebrows raise.</p>
            <p>“—no, yeah, updating it every few days or so”</p>
            <p>“good. That should be enough, its got everything  that I had on her. All of the uh” he points to the cameras in the corners of the ceiling. He looks outside for a few seconds. “remember that’ll be our  contingency. You know in case we don’t” his eyes go blank, “in case we can’t…  uhh. and you know how to work it?”</p>
            <p>“for sure, Don. We’ve been uploading everything”</p>
            <p>“good”. As he blinks one eye, his upper cheek went with it. “Now… go to her room! hahahaha, nah just kidding. But not really. Don’t let me catch you two not working. And stop with the cigarettes,” he winks, looking dan in the eye, which makes him wince.</p>
            <p>Once the door is slammed John looked out at the men revving up their motorcycles, and riding after Don in an unbelievably loud procession down to the Amazon grocery store’s outdoor seating area.</p>
            <p>The afternoon welled with birdsong.</p>
            <p>“…He’s not as fat as I thought he’d be.”</p>
            <p>“Lemme light that roach back up… you want anything to eat?”</p>
            <p>John wiped the lubricant off of himself and slung up his pants, standing with barechest, stony jawed, strong build, like he was a little cockeyed staring out the window all fogged and distant.</p>
            <p>“…Its been a week, we’ve been in every room in this house. I don’t know if anythings gonna turn up.”</p>
            <p>“There is that other thing”</p>
            <p>Dan looked up at his partner, who past pointing at his tongue.</p>
            <p>“no”</p>
            <p>“It doesn’t hurt to try things the old fashioned way. We ”</p>
            <p>“Cops can’t do that John. You know it. I cant do it. It just, it goes against everything.”</p>
            <p>***</p>
            <p>	i was tugging on daddys arm who didnt realy look down at me because he was in a hurry to get thru the line. And then a big princess comes into view, and she was reall pretty and all her movements were certain and cool and she’d like spin like she was Dancing, floating, and to wave a wand—… but as i got closer i keept seeing her doing it, do the Dance and flick and touch the nose of the kid (to their big squealey smile) and i become a bit more touchey seeing her repeat the same moves and, coming into earshot, hear the same inflections,* my stomach falls when i cant tell if shes real or one of the animatronics.— i can hear phase-like screams going into and out of funnels far away (if i close my eyes its a sphere of pillowing sound). Cloying hot overwrought music and swells of of tinned character-voices from their headrests. 
            only 3-5 people in front of us now. Her face i can see now is like, like a   car engine     . Shes saying the words and going thru the motions (she was so pretty that i almmost startted crying becuz i was scarred but dad didnt hhe didnt even notice or look down frum above hus leatfvher coller) as frozen-in-time. Repeating moves from tv shes repeating over and ovean essept when i see her eyes and kno shes froze muted and interminable— and im up and see bends down to me our eyes locked— eyes caged behind a branded cage— and i started running</p>
            <p>theres a baby in somebody’s lagged kitchen sitting on the tiles.. Who starts to sputter and cough—</p>
            <p>and now i can see something adhering to the dimensions of the little face, that detects the contours of the soft head and clings in them. Like if there was a 3d plane for each slight fold and rise of the sea of rose cheeks, the top of the chin, forehead curve, the depression of the eyesockets — theres—  many different features rapidly switching—all bright-hazy and semi-translucent— pale light spreading from inside the thick fluid—… the faces are strangers at first, and they look like tacked-on, shoddy masks snapping into place and out of place. They all had a slightly time-delayed projection of a facial feature of someone familiar, moving in jarred dispositions, someone famous or someone in my family,  occluding and brightening in the overlap, re-centering on the wagging head, which is crying out as the volume is going down, and if the head turns its displaced for a splitsecond… the faces get clearer now i recognize them and facial expression of emotion becomes more constricted. The mask sets and becomes lapsingly cohesive— into something familiar</p>
            <p>I realize at this point that my thumb is depressing a rubber-suede, mauve button on the remote.  i was seeing like (un)recognizable movie star faces— shimmery blonde hair, dark eyes, different colors, light currentPoint.x >= (light.x - light.radius) settings.</p>
            <p>smooth cheeks, effervescent skin, reflexive whites of eyes w receding crosses in windowframes, bright spots like cameras in a dark stadium, like pins-and-needles. And for instants the baby would lean back and tilt its head upwards— and id see their real face again, and it’d get instantly covered back up, projected-over, and calibrated-for, like coming from underwater, (I RECOGNIZED their OWN FACE HIDDEN UNDERNEATH— BECAUSE THATS MY CHILD IS SUFFOCATING!! ), emerging from occlusion of PopularFeaturesofInfluence Agents™ —until to set into shape, and these celebrity features assimilated to a face that looked like….mine… I uncramped my thumb from the clicker. A disney logo swoons out of a shooting star that hangs from a dewdrop on the end of a willow tree, and plasters over the screen. Media machines MAKE MY BABEYS IN A METAL MOUTH.</p>

                the living body is escaping fromt he far reaches, the living body is evicted from oblivion, from being un-done, from being unmade it is liberated. The body escaped and it was sexualized. The clear-lacquer (neon imprint on the inner surface of your mouth)— they slip among u in the mediated worlds. The grand silicon valley (stanford SSRI, Berkley, Toronto, cambridge, MIT, UCLA, harvard) slipped thru the cracks— has bright h e a t e d lines & wres i can slip in and puncture, that enter me— I wanna sexualize it. I like the bright reflective skin of artificial windows on the animated girls— i like how u can almost see urself in it. I like the shininess of the human reflection— the bare light that rises like a mist off the skin of my angels. (sloly quake the orange light comes thru, the rain is drawn down the tiny squares, left open to the wind; the mainy nosepointed shapes in unison Dance the shape of an unknown continent. Divots of redaction of the rain in metal wires— impossibl. Laughter like a conniving, coaxing ghost. How many dumb windows behind computer screens?) the animal body is living now and its sexual-surfaces invite the lonely.

Wasn’t anything before but genes and unattributed flesh, incumbent, producing a neural substrate satisfied only by imitating— she unconsciously mimics their expressions— shows her friends, encodes positive reactions. She musters the image, and is thereby flooded with memories of other positive moments, coding association. Perform, feel good— Plastic associations w/ image-ads. My face fucked-up with movie stars, BE THAT— brand names as necessary step. In my sleep i hear them, and associations  in lateral post central gyrus within the parietal lobe— making me an avatar.

            <p>The mall is open for me on an auto-installment-plan. I stroll the promenade picking up ‘Cash. I’m genuinely afraid that if i pull off this mask there’ll b nothing left cuz its UNDOABLE INSIDE cuz they know you, made you, set the substrates in flesh.

Onto plastic and configurations of hues and pixels meant to activate meaningful associations & be thrown away— made to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>you’re the baby born inside the somabody. You’re made in actorbodies, susceptible to brand names colored happy Associations w/ You & Your Interests.

            <p>reconstructions of fictional events consumed next to people— you were repeatedly conditioned on each contact, remembrance, reappearance—  diverted and stored in the endless silos. a false paradise, but eye dint go all the way thru…  umhmm..
