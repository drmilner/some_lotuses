            <p>““by the year 2000, information and knowledge may be as important as mobility. On a good wall map, one can see the general features of a continent from the middle of a room. To examine the boundaries of states, it is necessary only to step closer. From reading distance, the names of cities and towns can be made out and the courses of rivers can be followed. It is interesting to extrapolate to very high resolution and dynamic presentation. If display capabilities should in- crease as rapidly as memory capabilities, one may some- day watch a display on a very large wall, examine the weather situation in the Midwest, and then with a mag- nifying glass follow the movement of an individual auto- mobile from Chicago, reading the names of the streets and highways along which it moves,  It seems to us that there is some merit in trying to develop such large-scale, high-resolution dynamic displays for group- computer interaction,”</p>
            <p>[sounds of a long country drive fade in]</p>
            <p>A microphone surreptitiously activated in a dragnet, records and transmits words spoken proximate to a glass and metal cell phone— under noise of heavy pressure differences and eddy currents vibrating across the mylar plastic diaphragm in the air current, is making them discernible only intermittently, and, cutting out to altogether silence for seconds at a time during the loss of access of 0.3 GHz (VHF) to 30 GHz (Ka-band) wavelengths, on the order of one meter down to below one centimeter,  modulated RF wave containing a transduced-and-packeted, 150,000 kilometer per second female voice, as that invisible light refracts into the sky’s suspended water droplets, is bounced and frustrated by mountains, and finally, for conditions not known, lost during transit due to an unexplained Frustrated Total Internal Reflection-type evanescent-wave coupling/overlapping* event. After a persistent period without signal, a minimum collection standard is activated, and the recording is cut off.</p>
            <p>* Frustrated TIR “Describes the total internal reflection process that occurs when the internal angle of incidence is equal to or greater than the critical angle”. “When light traveling in a denser medium (like glass) hits the boundary at a steep enough angle. If the angle is large enough, called the critical angle, all of the light reflects back into the first medium - none of it refracts into the second. This complete bounce-back is TIR”, and is exploited for telecommunications. When the reflection of light no longer passes through a glass coaxial cable, along the cylinder of many reflections, and its light’s reflections are propagated neither forwards to the receiver nor backwards to the sender’s transmission interface. The waves that needed to be kept discrete in order to discernible, instead are joined,  irretrievably, with each other, and their light spills into wrapping tape and rubber and seawater whereon it is perceived only by the extremely light sensitive-eyes nearby on the ocean floor. And so it was only these creates to whom Annie was, in any literal sense, speaking to.</p>
            <p>(wut hey were in it in the reason why dem sepreations had to take place is nobodys fault); Annies’ driving far from Chicago, in a red car with the sun screaming in your hair, o LOVE you o myannie, burning, pushing downward, 55 between indiana and illinois on the way out of the city; only she’s going 105 threading between cars and stoned stoned from that wind plus the sunlight from breath in that swarming gold, tase like, b’god, FREEDOM, or, no, (so this isn’t crazy, and I don’t have to tell its not crazy because it NOT crazy— that is, (because i know i have been thinking a lot of crazy stuff lately) its not because EVERYTHINGS implicit in this feeling— why i’d feel like this, righteous anger but also lifted up in this carseat like i’m hovering just above the seat but also propelled forward & rise above this car on another trajectory, sit down rooted bcuzza whaddi gotta DO! I feel crazy like i feel i have something  to do on this earth(?) who said i’m 20 years old and can’t have something on this earth i’m destined fir\\or— because i CARE about life. Urrm. Uhuh..) lt’s like bright white sheet is soft and rolling over my face, but won’t touch me, it sifts through me just like golden grain & warm seeds down your arms protruding in my spirit prick’d up and flying with it the wind that comes thru that light, moving in that slowave, pulled apart on gentle riptide. Im deaftoned waif & solemn but contented and blissed-up to my ears because my spirits’ loosed and flirting with god and im consistently remembering dreams: shocked into them for a second moves to spark little flicks of swifts of cornfields (non-stop cornfields thru Iowa), + calm grass, diverging and re-convening via our common move, common slooth, sloom, moome, convergences— its a little like that feeling like a really deep stretch that pulls your spine out of the muscles holding it in u never can reach, pulled loose from common attachments, my regular body, thats like my whole body i move away from but not frightened this time because i’m not dreaming & not forcing it on myself, like a photon shot in-between twin slits in a doorway, I rebound and come back as a wave. i mean, i’d like to say its sexual but its really not anything like that um..)) counting the gorges under bridges where river flows before davenport, by the Illinois border, and again by Demoines, shuffling wetfootie beneath us just as easily could look up at the sky— concrete blocks w/ jagged edge and rusty pylon red beam like broken fingers desiccated & succumbing to the ebb of disintegration carries u allll the way to Louisiana if u wanted… why i feel theres some kind of propulsion to my life i don’t have to force or eek out anymore— i never felt like this except high school maybe it felt endless because it like there were nothing but possibilities justassoon as i could leave hme… WERE IT NOT SO… but whereigo whereigo whereigo annie annie annie hi i shhhhhh pls no shush my tad-eye pluss, pless, plsm, annie, i make-it-go, naow nouw, i go, slimmy-treetwisty forward up green spinsaway dark and green and shadey by a lighthouse— that crook at the base where the trunk explodes into branches, at tht crux, like, VAGINAL, or somefing huheuhe. Hm. Eeehh. Ono i fart, i not allow’d) — (That thing is like when i call my sister on the phone and we twitch at the same time like wombbabies sailing in the back seat, weavey thru traffic, or when i say in a cafeteria “i love you” in my head and then someone briskly jerk up and leave with newspaper unnerarm; or u go to text me after 50 minutes and i see the speech bubble appear RIGHT when i start to speak…) and where do u gotta go when U wnt to smash a tyrannical emblem? why, HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA! For the last voyage of its kind to the spiritual black-hole of the Nation, sucking the vain low basin from the 4 corners, all that black-back mirror pulling you, you, you, you, U, yu— YOU ! before it all finally fades away into obscurity & infinite obsolescence from multiplication of other medias ina fracturing explosion of interconnected mediums, u go to the source, U GO TO SMASSHIT UH ANNEI? U GETTIT?</p>
            <p> hiding low on the spine of the country like a wizard. America is a maze, walls keep getting put up until theres only one way out, but its not the way they designed it for. Tumble over the petal of a city sized flower.</p>
            <p> (Annie blonde hair was blurry and partially opaque glowing and soft at edges backed by bright orange spread out ball, struck magnifying on a thin curved surface--) Hushcalm of mangroves in florida. This sky a stark dome— grey smoke an whistling birds: TUNEIN AM AMMGO DUNNJON, am anngo LOOKSLIKE SECRET TREEBLOW AD COLORED MIST ORSNGE SUCKS IN TO IT NEEDLE AND TURNS HALFWAY BUE </p>
            <p>looseing my grip a bit i looked up with the  ashen oak (annie blonde hair was blurry and partially opaque glowing and soft at edges) alie was panting hot. She’s pulled over in dirt under canopy. March diamonds bumble in the rainwater. Annie sat under a tree, writing in her journal.</p>
            <p>you stay the same and we embody eachothers million different characters just to stick around. I guess i could still love u when i fade away. When u turn to light glass and dissappear inside me as a vacant neural-celestial pattern, one which recombines— thadda be best becaus if i ever meet you again we’ll know eachother. Or once ever now and i’ll see u in a dream.   that all fine. I love u just the same if u became something else— because if i werent meant to i wouldn’n if i was i did. It really dont matter cause its a continual-stream which u never enter or leave. Ur not a memory or a profile or a picture or a saved video or anithin ur alive… ill love anybody tho maybe…”</p>
            <p>“howm we get here alie?” zipping her jeans.</p>
            <p>Let go of the thought that others exist for your sake, and u can serve anybody. When everything i think needs to be …. Final, it makes thinking, just being by myself, into an endless failure.  Annie whispers,"I cant stand it Im tryng to do m’best." I camp next to the South Platte river. Big arid green weeds kinda whitish and dry medusa-heads teacolored on the ground. Sitting under a cottonwood, took off shoes. W a stolen bottle of bourbon from the chain-grocery. Drunk under stars inside her sleepinbag beside a big heavy tree.</p>
            <p>“O hey.” His little nose turning back-and-forth. He sits on the indent of her frail chest, panting. Cuddles up bobbing with breath.</p>

            <p>John pressed a button, and terabytes of data poured through the cable. Her online posts, all personal email and cell phone messages, webcam eyemovement data, purchase histories, finely-granular internet history, context-rich keystrokes, application IP, and GPS data, and entertainment history torrented down the wire into the device, along with reams of information and recordings they took on the inside of her house and room, and school. The baby quickly began to squirm, and sputter.</p>

            <p>Neural activity in the rodent hippocampus serves as an real-time internal model of external space. These hippocampal neurons, are called place cells1,2, activate in particular environments where the rat travels, and their cell-firing sequences specify certain external places. These sequences that represent particular places in the world formed when exploring new spaces , and then re-fired (or re-played) during sleep to form into long-term memory, 11,12, , creating a neural repertoire of remembered places, in the form of latent combinations of cell activation.</p>
            <p>	It has been observed however,  that cell sequences for specific places have activated while rats are asleep the night before they go to new places. They called it preplay. The pre-configured sequences of cell firings that create the subjective experience of being somewhere in dreams, appears to form the neurological basis of recognizing places the rats never been to. New experiences appears ‘select’ from a preconfigured set  of dreamed sequences (Dragoi, Tonegawa, 2013) , and then the two, it is believed, rapidly bind together, when they are similar enough ( Gómez-Ocádiz, Trippa, 2022). One experiment found new places matched to pre-played maps 6-7% of the time in rats (Dragoi, Tonegawa, 2011; 2013). As if new places are recognized beforehand, in dreams. </p>

            <p>“a few functions that appear from one point of view to be mere details, to occupy low levels in the over-all system, are seen from another point of view to be both basic and ubiquitous. One of these functions that looks like a technical detail from one standpoint and like some- thing very basic and general from another is the encoding of elements of information for storage in a digital mem- ory. The instructions of encoding information are themselves encoded as information with their own instructions. Let us, for the purposes of this discussion, adopt the point of view from which that seems important.” </p>
            <p>COLORADO-WYOMING 1/12/16</p>
            <p>Annie looked up bleareyed, sat up and got naked and jumped in the river and sat down her bare ass in the silt and stared up at the sprawwling cottonwood arranging its blowy arms up that twist unrepeatable and alone. And come back to her car with dirt-sneakers, feet wet in socks, to find two moussle-haired mechanics standing aginst the wall appraising her stationwagon like two seagulls, itching their chins in greasy shirts— one with a coke bottlew no label. Didn’t acknowledge them when she got back in the car. Hair cold & wet against her neck sleek-lined like a porpoise with pearl neck in the cold blue sun. Ready to drawl over lowland Iowa flats, the sun crawling up into the trees with sombre coldness, to the fatty mounds of nebraska til they get all shrubby and start to wobble up higher and higher into colorado cacti and then mountains (and later red mountains of utah), fluffy white grass, scrub and tundra. Long passages alongside freight tracks. Narrow ridges and falls of valley.</p>
            <p>the locus of that movement—</p>
            <p>white street, grey truck tire imprints, spotted bedding the houses like tundra, brittle grasses— goldenrim clouds with shiver spine of airplane— sunrise thru the ponderosas— water containers looking</p>
            <p>big nipples under a black shirt- and the snowed (cowed) mount w/ crown of mist on either side of the vanishing end of the highway , further signs of fast food, billboards for food items, the universe now appears imported from the past.</p>
            <p>sunbeams lke eyelashes wink in a slit of grey sieves, expressed behind the body of the mountains tucked forminddable and stalwart, beyond septic tanks and water tower paint, giant drums— for an instant shows the birth and death of all things. Hills, houses, industry traintrack of light, sidwalk noones on, the roadside intersection littered w neon puddles of snowmelt. Supper places, tireshops, nobody in the cars. Wood-boarded up awnings, trees curl turning the white lign, sign glittering, under a tunnel mirrored by snow, along rooftop, exemplified instantly, and there alongside as always is a series of stretching horses— white real horses droop necks, furlfences unwind— spire cliffs crooking sharp steep black into the sky, its muddytree-eye silver mouth north, (like skies over running trains) mountain nests, schoolbus coming, no passengers. Freightcar bones whip up thru the forest, yellow flaky paint, i see the sun set in thru there, clipping branches, in a lightsieve of trees, branches twiddle and reveal blindly, mirrors, off my eyelid off a metal roof, my shirtcover, off the dashboard windshield and my fingernails, skin pale gold, on my cold face. The light retreated to the mountain’s neck. ( like times you sat in the snow and panted, gold and blue, heavy pants) Its all peeling and curving over the windshield, th universe refracting into my car. Did u kno i’d really love you? spotted, golden in the rearview, w/bugeye of smoke and rain as all bluepuddles and mountain fogs go off the floor of the world. Horses lay under wool blankets. Lumber and drivers of trucks w great claws on thm that grab the timber. Sleeping cows. Inhale blue, mountains u walk to, fills u like so clean and untainted (even w the smell of gasoline and woodchips) (its just that its all so.. I mean, l like i know that i’ve been here before, i recognize myself.)</p>
            <p>i put Alstair up on the dashboard now and he was excitedly fitting himself into this whole situation. This whole part of the country, god, where do i fit? taking the more northern route (back into the locus forest-ridden nowheres, lighting up the modicum of the greater body of all places— memory i lived inside-of, and have repose in cuz i feel like im not a kissup to anyone or anything and not even paying any mind) and for one of these relaxed instants, with the wind coming in on her face cold through the window but carefree and baked, seeing a fresh silverpoint of light like she just let out a little joy cause its alright— for one of those rare times not caring about that reflective surface of her skin— (..or of what makes this whole trip into a learning experience or valuable i mean you’re gonna sell it out for dirt—) with cupped little claws to flaring nose, on plastic that has the texture of leather (OOOOOOOoo cutest boy), his soul like water, a scuttle of soft pink feet. on a sharp turn flies into the passenger seat, and heaps himself now panting in the plush. i have been watching all these replays of self-arraigned selections of places populating th shuffled deck of my hippo, and shelling out my blanked abstract. I didnt see the spirits in this landscape tho marked anwhere on Maps, nor was i gunna, and none of them could be recorded. Moment-by-moment you can recall what you dreamed about: familiar to the precise second— like if you laid a sheet down on it and felt its contours, and you knew exactly what it was once but crossed a threshold and can’t remember— Lost downstream… sun blanketing all green-grey soft wavering scrub dotting the foot of the snow mountain, and crawling up its slope where its sparse, pale, dissected by the cold shadow of sundown, reminds you flaggingly of other instances. (and i feel its all mine but really I belong to it, all of this… ) recognition of this place culled from degraded networks of places, flowing like water down broken dresses, and adhering to codifying memory— complete circuits flash and recombine. You’ll not need to remember if you experience it again— and thats memory anyway. The rush and reintegration of the cell-assembly (from daisychain reinvented places) brought out. And. Brought. UP. Roiling and recoiling in the allocentric map of your earth: even in the dark able to see it, maps selectively activate— an association so wide and deep, it stretches around the horizon…</p>
            <p>Picture that youre at the ocean, and thers hundreds of buoys spread out on the water in a precise hexagonal grid, and you’re lying down flat on the sand, and you can only see the buoys when a wave comes through and pushes them up— and u see the wave go and get a picture of the spacing of the surface of the ocean when the waves push the buoys up… now a subset of those buoys coordinated into pattern represents particular memory of place you once visited, at particular time, and not just homogenous flat ocean could be anywhere in the world. it is so basic and essential, so deeply involved with so much of your life that it rarely clips above noise, except in real stillness… but when it does: it contains so many places, feelings, and times u couldn’t possibly take account. Old experiences reknown and made new, did you know the cell-phase of the entorhinal map will destabilize if you dont move? the longer you stay still, the less familiar the world gets. Staring at the same walls, and they become strangers.</p>
