From light to light of cities as silently rattled-off file_locations and offshore limits are issueing from the snow, huddling, breathing  vapor  onto my hands. “Your shadows’ right in the windowsill, visible to pedestrians under rain sieves.

            <p>To: ann.mellonkamp94@gmail.com			￼  Trash - Google		 Today at 8:47 PM</p>
            <p>From: d.lick1965@darpa.gov</p>
            <p>CC:</p>
            <p>BCC:</p>
            <p>Subject: my future is your past</p>
            <p> As a medium for the display of information, the printed page is superb. It affords enough resolution to meet the eye's demand. It presents enough information to occupy the reader for a convenient quantum of time. It is small, light, movable, cuttable, clippable, pastable, replicable, dis- posable, and inexpensive. Those positive attributes all relate, as indicated, to the display function. But The tallies that could be made for the storage, organization, and re- trieval functions are less favorable. Whats of basic interest is not the print or paper, and not the words and sentences themselves — but the facts, concepts, principles, and ideas that lie behind the visible and tangible aspects of documents.</p>
            <p>…When printed pages are bound together to make books, they are bulky and heavy. They contain much more information than the reader can apprehend at any given moment. Except for use in consecutive reading, books are not very good display de- vices. In fulfilling the storage function, they are only fair. With respect to retrievability they are poor. And when it comes to organizing the body of knowledge, indexing and abstracting it, books make no active contribution at all. Surveying a million books on ten thousand shelves, one might suppose that the diffi- culty is basically logistic, that it derives from the gross physical arrangement. In part, of course, that is true, but in much greater part the trouble stems from what we may call the "passiveness" of the printed page. When information is stored in books, there is no practical way to determine prescribed func- tions of information within the books without asking the reader to carry out all the necessary operations herself. </p>
            <p>Later that same day, cradling a cup of coffee, John scrolled through Annie’s email trash. He recognized the passage pretty quickly. It was pretty much a holy text, as far as DARPA academy* was concerned. The internet’s book of genesis. The Libraries of the Future, by D.C Licklider: 1965. </p>
